Whether you’re just getting started or you’re a seasoned pythonista, pythoneer, or ${INSERT_YOUR_VERB_HERE}, you’ve probably found managing your python environments to be tedious and rather painful. Managing Python versions, libraries, and various dependencies is like playing shuffle board where the object is to not hit any other puck; if you do, the probability of a cascading effect of pucks flying everywhere you don’t want them to be will soon follow. Perhaps a (╯°□°)╯︵ uoɥʇʎd moment will occur. Let’s mitigate that.

# Usage

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Ensure you have both [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and [direnv](https://direnv.net/) installed on your system.

## Installation

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Navigate to the root dir of a python project and copy down this projects `.envrc`.  Having the file in this dir will trigger `direnv` to prompt you to allow execution of that file.

```sh
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamjohnnym/auto-pyvenv/master/.envrc
direnv: error .envrc is blocked. Run `direnv allow` to approve its content.
$ direnv allow
direnv: loading .envrc
Installing virtualenv for Python 3.7.0
Activating Python 3.7.0 virtualenv
Virtualenv has been activated for Python 3.7.0
/Users/iamjohnnym/.personal/tutorials/pyenv-direnv/.venv/bin/python
direnv: export +VIRTUAL_ENV ~PATH
```

## Uninstallation

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

```sh
$ rm .envrc
```
